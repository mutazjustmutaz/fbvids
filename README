UPDATE: Facebook changed its code, so this script doesn't work anymore. I'll write a new script, or modify this one, once I get around to it.


  This is a script that downloads Facebook videos. The script relies on nothing beyond 3 standard libraries, which means that it requires no installation of any additional library or software. As long as Python is installed on your PC, you're ready to go.

Usage:

python fbvids.py "URL"

(The double quotes are necessary to prevent the shell from chopping up URLs with ampersands)

Notes:

_If available, the HD version of the video is downloaded by default. 

_I didn't put the script in module form because when it comes to simple scripts like this one the result would be ugly, over-built code.
